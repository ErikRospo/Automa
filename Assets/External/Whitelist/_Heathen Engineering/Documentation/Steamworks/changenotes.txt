v2019.2.11

Note:
This build uses a modified version of Steamworks.NET v15 based on Steamworks SDK v1.51
The modification corrects for a known issue involving the GameServer.Init method and bindings on on the m_usSteam port change introduced in SDK v1.51

Patch Notes:
- Updated the evtValueChanged event on StatObject to reflect the common naming pattern for events
- Added AddFloatStat and AddIntStat members to the StatObject so that it will be avialable on all stat types. This can be used to add to the current stat value if any
- Modified Steamworks.NET SteamNetworkingMessage_t.cs according to https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/pull/425 this is supposed to resolve the release error when using Steam Networking Sockets
- Modified the Fizzy based Mirror Steam Networking transport to conform to pull 425 as noted above
- Updated and validated Mirror 46.0.4

====================
PLEASE NOTE
====================

Steamworks.NET comes preinstalled with this package in the folder ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/
If you already have Steamworks.NET installed you may need to resolve conflicts.
Of key importance is the assembly def "Setamworks.NET.asmdef" that we have added to ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/
This assembly def is referneced by our own asembly defs located in each module of the Framework. If this is not present and does not include Steamworks.NET's objects you will have issues. 

To resolve the common issue of 
CSteamId is not found are you missing an assembly reference

Please locate the Steamworks.NET.asmdef that we have included  which should be located at ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/Steamworks.NET.asmdef and move it to where ever you have Steamworks.NET plugin installed
such that it is housed within the Steamworks.NET folder that the plugin includes.

If you have issues where in Steam attempts to launch your game (or Spacewar) when you start simulating in Unity the most likely cause of this issue is that you do not have steam_appid.txt located in the root of your project.
steam_appid.txt is a simple text file that should be located in the root of your project (beside not in the Asset folder) it should contain only your app ID.

An example of a valid steam_appid.txt follows, only the content between the dashed lines should be used e.g. only the number 480 should be in the file.
               
               Start File
-----------------------------------------------
480
-----------------------------------------------
               End File
